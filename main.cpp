  Gameplan:

  Get user input
    1: function to use
    2: initial guess
    3: derivative? (would be nice to calculate derivative down the road)
    4: largest allowed adjustment value
      validate?

  Pass function & initial guess into function parser to get f(xn) 
    Return f(xn)

  Pass f' into function parser to get f'(xn)
    Return f'(xn)

  Calculate adjustment amount
    f(xn)/f'(xn)
    validate?

  Calc Xn+1
    Xn - adjustment = Xn+1

  Continue to iterate until adjustment amount is less than required
